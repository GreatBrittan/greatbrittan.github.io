# GreatBrittan's C++ Journey

## Week 2:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I started looking into C++ and JS videos and books to try to learn more about both languages, What I found was that C++ is the staple for game development. My plan is to build a top down adventure game so I think that, per the proffessor's recommendation I am gonna stick with C++. I have also been working on my Github Pages site and trying to get a better C++ understanding through tackling Leetcode problems.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This Week I plan on furthering my exploration of C++ and trying to learn more about what goes into making a game using C++, This also will require me to learn more about Object Oriented Programming in C. I also would like to use custom art and sprites for the game so I will need to either utilize some sort of sprite making software. However I have a few artist friends who are very skilled that I might rely on only for the graphics.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way, besides the Leetcode premium paywall.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that last week I wasn't as committed to my project and the independent study required of this class. I am the type of person who needs the pressure on them to preform. However, after the end of last week and beginning of this week I have been really enjoying having time to study new languages and techniques. I think going forward I will try to keep a strict schedule of daily learning, coding and project planning. I think by sticking to a strict schedule with daily time requirements.Â

## Week 3:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week, I began watching C++ instructional videos when it comes to game development, I am still trying to decide the style of the game as it seems that platform games are some of the simplest to implement, however I would like to challenge myself and continue with my original idea. In addition I kept working through leetcode problems using C++ to further develop my understanding of the language, I am currently on an 8 day streak and would like to try to continue this through the course. As well, I began making attempts at sprite art, however I am far from an artist so these early attempts aren't very good.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to continue watching videos to further my understanding of the intersection of C++ and gamedevlopment. I also plan on continuing with leetcode practice and furthering my streak of daily challenges to 15. I would also like to begin practicing creating games and getting them up and running. In addition I would like to also like to familiarize myself more with github pages, my friend who is a SE uses github pages for his personal portfolio and it sounds very cheap and intuitive.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
Currently I am away from my primary machine as I am visiting family; I am currently working on my laptop which hampers my ability to work as efficiently. However, midway through this week I will return home and can continue working in original form, on my primary machine. Also, that leetcode premium membership is looking more enticing by the week.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week I was primarily focused on becoming more familiar with C++, however most of this studying was review as I learned alot of the language in my data structures class. I felt that I was able to learn more through leetcode practice than by simply watching tutorials. In addition, the things I learned through practice are more engrained in my memory than the what I watched in the tutorials. Knowing this I am going to try to do more practice with C++ and game development by creating projects, this way I will retain more information than simply watching lectures. I still want to continue watching tutorials, however I will allocate more time to practicing than viewing this week. I think this will allow me to have a more concrete understanding of C++. 

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 4:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I continued working on learning C++, My time was spent mostly watching tutorial videos and practicing leetcode problems. I have maintained a daily leetcode streak since first setting out on this project. I wasn't able to start a project as a significant amount of time was spent getting the compiler to work on my laptop. I watched mostly C++ instructional videos as well as videos regarding C++ game development and the steps and tools required.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to create a project to experiment with player movement, and collision with the game world. I would like to get this project up an running as soon as possible to continue to build on this knowledge to fully flesh out the game. I also plan on continuing my leetcode streak, I plan on continuing through the entire course so I would like to add another 7 days to the streak this week. In addition I plan on continuing my education through supplemental tutorials.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
This week, I will be travelling again to see family which means I will be using my laptop for programming. Since last week I have become more efficient at working on my project on the laptop so this week will hopefully be more productive than last week.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that understanding the project outline and how to organize the files is a crucial first step, I think by practcing using smaller projects I can ideally structure my project files to be seamless and easily understandable. This week I will work on structuring and creating a projec to get some of the parts working for the final project. I hope that this initial project serves as the first springboard to propel me towards success.

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 5:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I kept working on expanding my knowledge with C++, as well as furthering my understanding of the intersection of gamedevelopment and C++. I also continued work in leetcode as well as began working on creating projects to practice the neccesary skills for this project.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to get working projects as a proof of concept for many features I intend to introcude into my project. I want to continue my education on C++ as well. In addition I would like to continue my leetcode work and maintain the daily problem streak I am currently on.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
This week I have been very pressed for time, I am in my hometown visiting family in hospital so I haven't had much time to dedicate towards furthering the project. 

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that so far the process has been going well, I would like to create more projects. I think once I am back at my workstation and able to fully focus on my work I will be able to achieve much more progress than what was acomplished last week.

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 6:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I began working on a C++ project utilizing keyboard input to move a sprite on the screen. I have also been keeping up my daily leetcode practice, as well as utilizing C++ in my other assignments to continue my practice.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to continue working on my project to move the sprite using the keyboard, I plan on creating borders and collision, as well as potentially implementing new movement styles such as acceleration and deceleration.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way this week. 

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week I was very busy and didn't have as much time, because of this I lost my leetcode streak and didn't get much done. I was able to retain the streak using the time travel token however, I am still upset that I allowed it to end. In order to make this better I plan on being more consistent with allowing myself time to work on my projects and C++.

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 7:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I kept working on my C++ project, I also continued watchin tutorials and instructional videos, in addition I attempted to continue leetcode practice and maintain a daily problem streak.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to finsih my current project on movement and work on building out levels to traverse, as well as try to blend the last project with the new one to begin building towards a functioning game. 

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way this week. 

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week I got careless and forgot to do the daily leetcode problem, and beacause of this lost my daily steak, I am upset but I will try to maintain the new one I started in it's place. I think that staying consistent is very important so I will try to do better moving forward. 

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 8:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I wasn't able to get much done, I am moving right now and haven't had much time to work on my project.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
I plan to continue working on my individual projects and continue practicing leetcode and working through more tutorial videos. I'm hoping to get my internet setup and my workstation setup to be able to keep working.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
The impediments in my way are getting my internet and pc setup 

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week was hectic, lots of stressors and planning issues. Looking back I could have gotten the moving process started sooner so I could be more ready. I need to continue to stay consistent moving forward as I have already had many delays due to life circumstances.


<br /> 
<br />

## Week 9:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I continued to work on the game engine, adding colision to the player model, as well as adjusting the movement to be independent of the fps of the game. I tried to continue the leetcode streak and continued to watch c++ videos and game development videos to continue to make progress.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to continue working on the engine, adding custom movements such as sprinting or dodging as well as stylizing the playing area and the player character. I also intend to continue to craft the story and gameplay desing of the game and add features that support this gameplay. 

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
The only impediment in my way is creative vision, and decided how I want the gameplay to function.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week It was very difficult to manage my time as I was moving and unpacking my entire apartment. This brought alot of stress and challenges when trying to work on my project. Because of the constant attention the move required I lost my leetcode daily streak, this was sad but slightly liberating as I felt preassure to answer the daily problem regardless of my knowledge of the solution. This caused me to be careless when answering some of the harder problems as I was more concerned with simply getting the correct answer than understanding the problem. For these reasons I've decided to forgo the daily streak and instead simply try to stay consistent with a few problems a week. This way I can spend longer understanding the optimal solutions and not be as stressed to complete it daily.

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 10:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I implemented improved movement into the game engine, including dashes and scaling the movement properly, independent of frame rate. I also worked on implemening level design and creating enemies for the player to interact with.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to continue implemening and desgining the levels and gameplay mechanics, as well as working on collision and enemy interactions. 

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week was dificult as I am at the stage where I need to design the gameplay and make it enjoyable, this is dificult as there are many different avenues I can take, so deciding on which ones to choose is challenging. I am excited to continue to develop it, and implement new features to fully flesh out the gameplay. I have taken a relaxed approach towards the daily leetcode problems which has taken away some stress however I haven't been able to complete as many problems. I think I am going to try to increase my leetcode practice for this week.

<br /> 
<br />

## Week 11:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I implemented enemies and enemy pathfinding, so far they're just blocks that follow the player around and kill the player if they make contact. I don't know if I should add projectiles, but I am worried about not finishing the project if I try to do too much. I still need to implement the enemy spawning and despawning.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to finish implementing the enemy design and implement attacks, as well I would like to add sprites and models so that it is not just rectangles on a plane. I need to finish working on enemy spawning and pathfinding before I can tackle those issues though. I think I am taking a hiatus from leetcode as I want to finish this project primarily so practicing my C++ will have to wait as I am already getting enough practice trying to implement new features. I am still lacking in creative vision for the game so this week I will also be working on desining the world and choosing the background and enemies. I don't know if there is time to craft a story or any sort of dialogue.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week made me realize how much problemsolving goes into each step in the game development process. I figured there would be tride and true techniques for enemy spawning and pathfinding, however it is very much up to the individual game developer to figure out how to develop these features. While there is good advice online, there is a tremendous amount of trial and error that goes into the process. This makes me nervous for being able to finish the project on time as it is taking a long time to add each new feature. However, I still have confidence that it will all come together.
