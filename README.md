## Week 2:

##### What did you do last week?


Last week I started looking into C++ and JS videos and books to try to learn more about both languages, What I found was that C++ is the staple for game development. My plan is to build a top down adventure game so I think that, per the proffessor's recommendation I am gonna stick with C++. I have also been working on my Github Pages site and trying to get a better C++ understanding through tackling Leetcode problems.




##### What do you plan to do this week?


This Week I plan on furthering my exploration of C++ and trying to learn more about what goes into making a game using C++, This also will require me to learn more about Object Oriented Programming in C. I also would like to use custom art and sprites for the game so I will need to either utilize some sort of sprite making software. However I have a few artist friends who are very skilled that I might rely on only for the graphics.




##### Are there any impediments in your way?




There are no impediments in my way, besides the Leetcode premium paywall.




##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?


I think that last week I wasn't as committed to my project and the independent study required of this class. I am the type of person who needs the pressure on them to preform. However, after the end of last week and beginning of this week I have been really enjoying having time to study new languages and techniques. I think going forward I will try to keep a strict schedule of daily learning, coding and project planning. I think by sticking to a strict schedule with daily time requirements.Â
