# GreatBrittan's C++ Journey

## Week 2:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I started looking into C++ and JS videos and books to try to learn more about both languages, What I found was that C++ is the staple for game development. My plan is to build a top down adventure game so I think that, per the proffessor's recommendation I am gonna stick with C++. I have also been working on my Github Pages site and trying to get a better C++ understanding through tackling Leetcode problems.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This Week I plan on furthering my exploration of C++ and trying to learn more about what goes into making a game using C++, This also will require me to learn more about Object Oriented Programming in C. I also would like to use custom art and sprites for the game so I will need to either utilize some sort of sprite making software. However I have a few artist friends who are very skilled that I might rely on only for the graphics.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way, besides the Leetcode premium paywall.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that last week I wasn't as committed to my project and the independent study required of this class. I am the type of person who needs the pressure on them to preform. However, after the end of last week and beginning of this week I have been really enjoying having time to study new languages and techniques. I think going forward I will try to keep a strict schedule of daily learning, coding and project planning. I think by sticking to a strict schedule with daily time requirements.Â

## Week 3:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week, I began watching C++ instructional videos when it comes to game development, I am still trying to decide the style of the game as it seems that platform games are some of the simplest to implement, however I would like to challenge myself and continue with my original idea. In addition I kept working through leetcode problems using C++ to further develop my understanding of the language, I am currently on an 8 day streak and would like to try to continue this through the course. As well, I began making attempts at sprite art, however I am far from an artist so these early attempts aren't very good.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to continue watching videos to further my understanding of the intersection of C++ and gamedevlopment. I also plan on continuing with leetcode practice and furthering my streak of daily challenges to 15. I would also like to begin practicing creating games and getting them up and running. In addition I would like to also like to familiarize myself more with github pages, my friend who is a SE uses github pages for his personal portfolio and it sounds very cheap and intuitive.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
Currently I am away from my primary machine as I am visiting family; I am currently working on my laptop which hampers my ability to work as efficiently. However, midway through this week I will return home and can continue working in original form, on my primary machine. Also, that leetcode premium membership is looking more enticing by the week.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week I was primarily focused on becoming more familiar with C++, however most of this studying was review as I learned alot of the language in my data structures class. I felt that I was able to learn more through leetcode practice than by simply watching tutorials. In addition, the things I learned through practice are more engrained in my memory than the what I watched in the tutorials. Knowing this I am going to try to do more practice with C++ and game development by creating projects, this way I will retain more information than simply watching lectures. I still want to continue watching tutorials, however I will allocate more time to practicing than viewing this week. I think this will allow me to have a more concrete understanding of C++.

## Week 4:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I continued working on learning C++, My time was spent mostly watching tutorial videos and practicing leetcode problems. I have maintained a daily leetcode streak since first setting out on this project. I wasn't able to start a project as a significant amount of time was spent getting the compiler to work on my laptop. I watched mostly C++ instructional videos as well as videos regarding C++ game development and the steps and tools required.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to create a project to experiment with player movement, and collision with the game world. I would like to get this project up an running as soon as possible to continue to build on this knowledge to fully flesh out the game. I also plan on continuing my leetcode streak, I plan on continuing through the entire course so I would like to add another 7 days to the streak this week. In addition I plan on continuing my education through supplemental tutorials.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
This week, I will be travelling again to see family which means I will be using my laptop for programming. Since last week I have become more efficient at working on my project on the laptop so this week will hopefully be more productive than last week.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that understanding the project outline and how to organize the files is a crucial first step, I think by practcing using smaller projects I can ideally structure my project files to be seamless and easily understandable. This week I will work on structuring and creating a projec to get some of the parts working for the final project. I hope that this initial project serves as the first springboard to propel me towards success.

## Week 5:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I kept working on expanding my knowledge with C++, as well as furthering my understanding of the intersection of gamedevelopment and C++. I also continued work in leetcode as well as began working on creating projects to practice the neccesary skills for this project.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to get working projects as a proof of concept for many features I intend to introcude into my project. I want to continue my education on C++ as well. In addition I would like to continue my leetcode work and maintain the daily problem streak I am currently on.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
This week I have been very pressed for time, I am in my hometown visiting family in hospital so I haven't had much time to dedicate towards furthering the project. 

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that so far the process has been going well, I would like to create more projects. I think once I am back at my workstation and able to fully focus on my work I will be able to achieve much more progress than what was acomplished last week.

## Week 6:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I began working on a C++ project utilizing keyboard input to move a sprite on the screen. I have also been keeping up my daily leetcode practice, as well as utilizing C++ in my other assignments to continue my practice.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to continue working on my project to move the sprite using the keyboard, I plan on creating borders and collision, as well as potentially implementing new movement styles such as acceleration and deceleration.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way this week. 

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week I was very busy and didn't have as much time, because of this I lost my leetcode streak and didn't get much done. I was able to retain the streak using the time travel token however, I am still upset that I allowed it to end. In order to make this better I plan on being more consistent with allowing myself time to work on my projects and C++.
