# GreatBrittan's C++ Journey

## Week 2:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week I started looking into C++ and JS videos and books to try to learn more about both languages, What I found was that C++ is the staple for game development. My plan is to build a top down adventure game so I think that, per the proffessor's recommendation I am gonna stick with C++. I have also been working on my Github Pages site and trying to get a better C++ understanding through tackling Leetcode problems.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This Week I plan on furthering my exploration of C++ and trying to learn more about what goes into making a game using C++, This also will require me to learn more about Object Oriented Programming in C. I also would like to use custom art and sprites for the game so I will need to either utilize some sort of sprite making software. However I have a few artist friends who are very skilled that I might rely on only for the graphics.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
There are no impediments in my way, besides the Leetcode premium paywall.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think that last week I wasn't as committed to my project and the independent study required of this class. I am the type of person who needs the pressure on them to preform. However, after the end of last week and beginning of this week I have been really enjoying having time to study new languages and techniques. I think going forward I will try to keep a strict schedule of daily learning, coding and project planning. I think by sticking to a strict schedule with daily time requirements.Â

## Week 3:

##### What did you do last week?
Last week, I began watching C++ instructional videos when it comes to game development, I am still trying to decide the style of the game as it seems that platform games are some of the simplest to implement, however I would like to challenge myself and continue with my original idea. In addition I kept working through leetcode problems using C++ to further develop my understanding of the language, I am currently on an 8 day streak and would like to try to continue this through the course. As well, I began making attempts at sprite art, however I am far from an artist so these early attempts aren't very good.

##### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to continue watching videos to further my understanding of the intersection of C++ and gamedevlopment. I also plan on continuing with leetcode practice and furthering my streak of daily challenges to 15. I would also like to begin practicing creating games and getting them up and running. In addition I would like to also like to familiarize myself more with github pages, my friend who is a SE uses github pages for his personal portfolio and it sounds very cheap and intuitive.

##### Are there any impediments in your way?
Currently I am away from my primary machine as I am visiting family; I am currently working on my laptop which hampers my ability to work as efficiently. However, midway through this week I will return home and can continue working in original form, on my primary machine. Also, that leetcode premium membership is looking more enticing by the week.

##### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week I was primarily focused on becoming more familiar with C++, however most of this studying was review as I learned alot of the language in my data structures class. I felt that I was able to learn more through leetcode practice than by simply watching tutorials. In addition, the things I learned through practice are more engrained in my memory than the what I watched in the tutorials. Knowing this I am going to try to do more practice with C++ and game development by creating projects, this way I will retain more information than simply watching lectures. I still want to continue watching tutorials, however I will allocate more time to practicing than viewing this week. I think this will allow me to have a more concrete understanding of C++.
